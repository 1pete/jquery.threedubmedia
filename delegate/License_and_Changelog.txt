Changes in Version 1.2, NOT Released

- Added a "filter" event property which holds the matched selector string

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.1, Released 2008-12-17

- Added a "stopDelegation" event method, to stop delegating up the parent chain.

- Created "matches" method to correctly check descendant selector. This allows 
more complex selectors to be handled correctly by the plugin. This new method 
does NOT handle multiple selector expressions, a deliberate choice to optimize 
performance for this plugin, where selectors are already broken into singular 
expression statements for storage and handling.

- Fixed binding with optional data, so each handler can have it's own "data"
